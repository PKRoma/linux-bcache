	Allows a block device to be used as cache for other devices; uses
	a btree for indexing and the layout is optimized for SSDs.

	See Documentation/bcache.txt for details.

config BCACHE_DEBUG

	Enables extra debugging tools, allows expensive runtime checks to be
	turned on.

config BCACHE_CLOSURES_DEBUG
	bool "Debug closures"
	depends on BCACHE
	select DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	Keeps all active closures in a linked list and provides a debugfs
	interface to list them, which makes it possible to see asynchronous
	operations that get stuck.

config BCACHE_NO_IO
	bool "Disable IO to underlying device"
	depends on BCACHE
	---help---
	Stubs out all the actual IO calls
