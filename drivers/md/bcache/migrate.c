 * This moves only the meta-data off, leaving the data (if any) in place.
 * The data is moved off by bch_move_data_off_device, if desired, and
 * called first.
 *
 * Before calling this, allocation of buckets to the device must have
 * been disabled, as else we'll continue to write meta-data to the device
 * when new buckets are picked for meta-data writes.
 * In addition, the copying gc and allocator threads for the device
 * must have been stopped.  The allocator thread is the only thread
 * that writes prio/gen information.
 *
 * Meta-data consists of:
 * - Btree nodes
 * - Prio/gen information
 * - Journal entries
 * - Superblock
 *
 * This has to move the btree nodes and the journal only:
 * - prio/gen information is not written once the allocator thread is stopped.
 *   also, as the prio/gen information is per-device it is not moved.
 * - the superblock will be written by the caller once after everything
 *   is stopped.
 *
 * Note that currently there is no way to stop btree node and journal
 * meta-data writes to a device without moving the meta-data because
 * once a bucket is open for a btree node, unless a replacement btree
 * node is allocated (and the tree updated), the bucket will continue
 * to be written with updates.  Similarly for the journal (it gets
 * written until filled).
 *
 * This routine leaves the data (if any) in place.  Whether the data
 * should be moved off is a decision independent of whether the meta
 * data should be moved off and stopped:
 *
 * - For device removal, both data and meta-data are moved off, in
 *   that order.
 *
 * - However, for turning a device read-only without removing it, only
 *   meta-data is moved off since that's the only way to prevent it
 *   from being written.  Data is left in the device, but no new data
 *   is written.
