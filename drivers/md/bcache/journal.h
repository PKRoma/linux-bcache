/*
 * THE JOURNAL:
 *
 * The primary purpose of the journal is to log updates (insertions) to the
 * b-tree, to avoid having to do synchronous updates to the b-tree on disk.
 *
 * Without the journal, the b-tree is always internally consistent on
 * disk - and in fact, in the earliest incarnations bcache didn't have a journal
 * but did handle unclean shutdowns by doing all index updates synchronously
 * (with coalescing).
 *
 * Updates to interior nodes still happen synchronously and without the journal
 * (for simplicity) - this may change eventually but updates to interior nodes
 * are rare enough it's not a huge priority.
 *
 * This means the journal is relatively separate from the b-tree; it consists of
 * just a list of keys and journal replay consists of just redoing those
 * insertions in same order that they appear in the journal.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE:
 *
 * For synchronous updates (where we're waiting on the index update to hit
 * disk), the journal entry will be written out immediately (or as soon as
 * possible, if the write for the previous journal entry was still in flight).
 *
 * Synchronous updates are specified by passing a closure (@flush_cl) to
 * bch_btree_insert() or bch_btree_insert_node(), which then pass that parameter
 * down to the journalling code. That closure will will wait on the journal
 * write to complete (via closure_wait()).
 *
 * If the index update wasn't synchronous, the journal entry will be
 * written out after 10 ms have elapsed, by default (the delay_ms field
 * in struct journal).
 *
 * JOURNAL ENTRIES:
 *
 * A journal entry is variable size (struct jset), it's got a fixed length
 * header and then a variable number of struct jset_entry entries.
 *
 * Journal entries are identified by monotonically increasing 64 bit sequence
 * numbers - jset->seq; other places in the code refer to this sequence number.
 *
 * A jset_entry entry contains one or more bkeys (which is what gets inserted
 * into the b-tree). We need a container to indicate which b-tree the key is
 * for; also, the roots of the various b-trees are stored in jset_entry entries
 * (one for each b-tree) - this lets us add new b-tree types without changing
 * the on disk format.
 *
 * We also keep some things in the journal header that are logically part of the
 * superblock - all the things that are frequently updated. This is for future
 * bcache on raw flash support; the superblock (which will become another
 * journal) can't be moved or wear leveled, so it contains just enough
 * information to find the main journal, and the superblock only has to be
 * rewritten when we want to move/wear level the main journal.
 *
 * JOURNAL LAYOUT ON DISK:
 *
 * The journal is written to a ringbuffer of buckets (which is kept in the
 * superblock); the individual buckets are not necessarily contiguous on disk
 * which means that journal entries are not allowed to span buckets, but also
 * that we can resize the journal at runtime if desired (unimplemented).
 *
 * The journal buckets exist in the same pool as all the other buckets that are
 * managed by the allocator and garbage collection - garbage collection marks
 * the journal buckets as metadata buckets.
 *
 * OPEN/DIRTY JOURNAL ENTRIES:
 *
 * Open/dirty journal entries are journal entries that contain b-tree updates
 * that have not yet been written out to the b-tree on disk. We have to track
 * which journal entries are dirty, and we also have to avoid wrapping around
 * the journal and overwriting old but still dirty journal entries with new
 * journal entries.
 *
 * On disk, this is represented with the "last_seq" field of struct jset;
 * last_seq is the first sequence number that journal replay has to replay.
 *
 * To avoid overwriting dirty journal entries on disk, we keep a mapping (in
 * journal_device->seq) of for each journal bucket, the highest sequence number
 * any journal entry it contains. Then, by comparing that against last_seq we
 * can determine whether that journal bucket contains dirty journal entries or
 * not.
 *
 * To track which journal entries are dirty, we maintain a fifo of refcounts
 * (where each entry corresponds to a specific sequence number) - when a ref
 * goes to 0, that journal entry is no longer dirty.
 *
 * Journalling of index updates is done at the same time as the b-tree itself is
 * being modified (see btree_insert_key()); when we add the key to the journal
 * the pending b-tree write takes a ref on the journal entry the key was added
 * to. If a pending b-tree write would need to take refs on multiple dirty
 * journal entries, it only keeps the ref on the oldest one (since a newer
 * journal entry will still be replayed if an older entry was dirty).
 *
 * JOURNAL FILLING UP:
 *
 * There are two ways the journal could fill up; either we could run out of
 * space to write to, or we could have too many open journal entries and run out
 * of room in the fifo of refcounts. Since those refcounts are decremented
 * without any locking we can't safely resize that fifo, so we handle it the
 * same way.
 *
 * If the journal fills up, we start flushing dirty btree nodes until we can
 * allocate space for a journal write again - preferentially flushing btree
 * nodes that are pinning the oldest journal entries first.
